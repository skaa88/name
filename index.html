        The Khustai National Park is world-famous for its successful
        reintroduction of Przewalski's Horse, Equus Przewalski, the only
        remaining wild horse, since 1992. In addition to the Takhi, as
        Mongolians call them, roaming freely in their homeland once again, the
        park and its surrounding area have much to offer to the lovers of nature
        and the culture of our beautiful country, located in the heartland of
        Asia. HNP is unique in that it is the only National Park that is managed
        by NGOs and financed by its income and does not receive any state
        subsidies. Therefore, HNP has developed a range of ecotourism
        initiatives to finance its conservation programs within the park.
        Incomes, earned through entrance fee, accommodation, souvenir sale, and
        donations, directly contribute to the Przewalski's Horse reintroduction
        program, as well as other research and conservation projects being
        undertaken within the park and its buffer zone.
